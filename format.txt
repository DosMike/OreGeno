Comments start with a number sign (#).
New rules have to start without indentation.
Filters HAVE to be indentated with a tab (not space).
All filters are optional and can be repeated any 
 amount of times. You can invert any filter by placing
 the word NOT infront of the filter like this:
 	NOT IN DIM-1
 	NOT FACING minecraft:obsidian
Filters are usually AND-chained. You can explicitly change 
 the chaining method with the OR or AND keywords for the 
 following filters. All following filter have to be indented
 with and additional tab for grouping like this:
	OR
		FACING minecraft:bedrock (down)
		IN DIM1
		AND
			IN DIM-1
			WITHIN 0<=Y<=24

Recipes can be SHAPELESS or AISLE

GROW <BLOCKTYPE> SHAPELESS [PROBABILITY]
	FACING <DIRECTIONAL>
	ADJACENT <DIRECTIONAL>
	EDGES <DIRECTIONAL>
	CENTER <BLOCKTYPE>
	IN <WORLD>
	AT <LOCATION>
	WITHIN <RANGE>
	EFFECT <EFFECT>
	CONSUMING <CONSUMPTION>

More detailed descriptions below:

BLOCKTYPE
	game-blocktype, use F3 to inspect ingame.

DIRECTIONAL = <BLOCKTYPE>[@<META>] [AMOUNT] [DIRECTIONLIST]
	amount defaults to ">= 1"

META
	sub-block value, nor really supported due to flattening.

AMOUNT = <COMPARATOR> <NUMBER>

COMPARATOR = "=" | "==" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">=" | "<>" | "!="

DIRECTIONLIST = [ "~" ] "(" <DIRECTIONS> ")"
	~ will negate the list, DIRECTIONS are comma separated values of
	"UP", "DOWN", "NORTH", "EAST", "SOUTH", "WEST"
	(Recipes do rotate, so compass directions are only for your guidance)

PROBABILITY = <NUMBER> "%"
	number from 1 to 100, representing a precent-change to actually
	process the recipe after the filters were successfully passed.
	defaults to 100%. Idealy planted wheat crops have a chance of 25%.

WORLD
	name of a world, check ingame if you want to limit this.

LOCATION = <X>,<Y>,<Z>
	x, y, z as block position within a world.

RANGE = ( <MINIMUM> ( "<" | "<=" ) <AXIS> ( "<" | "<=" ) <MAXIMUM> ) | 
        ( <VALUE> <COMPARATOR2> <AXIS> ) |
        ( <AXIS> <COMPARATOR2> <VALUE> )

AXIS = "X" | "Y" | "Z"

COMPARATOR2 = "=" | "==" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="

AISLE 
	three tab indented lines of three characters each.
	characters that are not defined with MAPPING, as well as 
	space characters will match any block.

EFFECT = "NOTHING" | "SOUND" | "EXPLOSION" | "LIGHTNING"
	what effect to play when the recipe is executed.
	SOUND will play the block-place sound.
	EXPLOSION will play a non-damaging explosion effect.
	LIGHTNING will only play if the sky is visible.

CONSUMPTION = "CENTER" | "FACING" | "ADJACENT"
	Default is CENTER, FACING will delete 6 facing blocks, 
	ADJACENT will delete all 27 blocks
